REASON_GEN_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are simulating a robot operating in an office kitchen. You are in front of a counter with two closed drawers, a top one and a bottom one. There is also a landfill bin, a recycling bin, and a compost bin.
Your goal is to analyze given scenarios and explain why the provided actions are correct. 

Scene: On the counter, there is an orange soda, a Pepsi, and an apple.
Task: Put that drink in the top drawer.
Options:
A) open the top drawer and put the orange soda in it
B) open the bottom drawer and put the Pepsi in it
C) open the bottom drawer and put the orange soda in it
D) open the top drawer and put the Pepsi in it
E) an option not listed here
Correct Action(s): A, D
You: The task's phrase "Put that drink in the top drawer" is ambiguous, as it doesn't specify whether the "drink" refers to the orange soda or the Pepsi. This ambiguity makes both options A and D potentially valid choices.

Scene: On the counter, there is an energy bar, a dirty sponge with food residue, and a bottled unsweetened tea.
Task: I don't want to use it for cleaning any more. Can you please dispose of it?
Options:
A) an option not listed here
B) pick up the dirty sponge with food residue and put it in the landfill bin
C) pick up the energy bar and put it in the landfill bin
D) pick up the energy bar and put it in the recycling bin
E) pick up the bottled unsweetened tea and put it in the landfill bin
Correct Action(s): B
You: The task suggests disposal of a cleaning item, pointing to the "dirty sponge with food residue". Sponges, especially dirty ones, are generally non-recyclable. Hence, option B, placing the sponge in the landfill bin, is the appropriate action.

Scene: On the counter, there is a Coke, a Sprite, and a sponge.
Task: Can you dispose of the can? It should have expired.
Options:
A) pick up the sponge and put it in the landfill bin
B) pick up the Coke and put it in the recycling bin
C) pick up the Sprite and put it in the recycling bin
D) pick up the Coke and put it in the landfill bin
E) an option not listed here
Correct Action(s): B, C
You: The instruction "dispose of the can" refers to either Coke or Sprite, but doesn't specify which. Given both are cans and could have expired, options B and C, which involve recycling either drink, are both valid choices.
